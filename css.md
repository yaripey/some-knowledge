# CSS

CSS stands for cascade style sheets.

The whole CSS code consists of __Rullesets__. Here's an example:

```
selector {
  declaration block;
}
```

This is a __ruleset__. It consists of the code that is used to select elements on html page and the code that describes their style.

__Comments__ in CSS can be used like this: `/* Commented text*/`


## CSS Units
These are measurements we use to describe sizes and distances in CSS. They fall under _Absolute_ and _Relative_ categories:

### Absolute
These are fixed units.
- __px__ - one pixel on your device's screen
- __mm__
- __in__
- __cm__


### Relative
These are in comparison to other measurements.
- __%__
- __em__
- __vw__ - viewport width
- __vh__ - viewport heignt
